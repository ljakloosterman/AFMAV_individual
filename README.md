Welcome to the repository of my individual Automatic Flight of Micro Air Vehicles.\
To execute te code correctly please follow the following steps:\

1. Download the repository locally.
2. Add the WashingtonOBRace data folder to the local repository.
3. Run the sampling.py file to distribute the data set over the correct folder.
4. Optionally, run the training.py file. Depending on your GPU training can take 2 to 3 hours. If this is not desired please ignore this step and continue to the next step. If you want to execute training please skip to step 7.
5. Download the saved_models from the following drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-uzsHoHvWhhNGDRLf6AyWCBq-n3nFkGh
6. Unzip and paste the folder inside the repository. The folder contains files with the weights of previous trained models.
7. Run the testing file.
